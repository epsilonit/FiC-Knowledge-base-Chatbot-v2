Lossless conversion from GitHub issue to yaml to Stac json
Can this be guaranteed? 

General assumption : yes! 

Can we a test this and demonstrate? 
YAML sidestep has been removed, but we're still struggling with the number of fields allowed by GitHub (50), see [project fields limitation](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/data-requests-issue-archive/issues/41)

I've now done my best to merge fields were possible in the latest version of the [Inventory Sheet](https://nilu365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Horizon2021_CUBE/Shared%20Documents/WP2%20-%20use/DataLayerInventory/Inventory_V3.xlsx?d=w8ada1b8c243b469d928864bbc24f95aa&csf=1&web=1&e=3cDnFH), as described in the Issue on [Additional Fields](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/data-requests-issue-archive/issues/49)
do we still need this issue in light of the new and updated data ingestion pipeline and the WebGUI?
since there are no more GitHub Issues involved, this is obsolete, and therefore closed
