website incomplete
After 1.5 years, the website still does not list all partners on the [partner page](https://fairicube.nilu.no/project-partners/). Likely  should be done ahead of the review, when reviewers get their own impression.
this issue was reported already but thanks for bringing it up.

Wies & co use the task planner below to keep track of the requests for the website and they are currently working on it
