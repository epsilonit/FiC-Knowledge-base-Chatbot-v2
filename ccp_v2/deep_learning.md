# Deep learning

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks, with many layers (hence “deep”), to analyze various levels of data abstraction. It’s particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition, where it can learn complex patterns directly from the data, improving its accuracy as more data is provided.
