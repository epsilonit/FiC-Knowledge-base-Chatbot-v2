# Pre-processing

Pre-processing, in the context of machine learning and data analysis, refers to the techniques used to prepare raw data for further processing and analysis. It involves cleaning, organizing, and transforming data to enhance its quality and ensure it is in a suitable format for creating accurate models or gaining meaningful insights. This step is crucial as it directly impacts the performance and reliability of the subsequent analysis or machine learning tasks.
