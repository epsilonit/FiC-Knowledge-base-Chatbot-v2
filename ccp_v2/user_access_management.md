# User and access management

This section contains a description of the user and access management procedures for the main FAIRiCUBE services and components.

## EOX Lab

The FAIRICUBE EOX Lab is a moderated service i.e. access has to be granted by an Administrator.
Once the access is granted the login is possible.

To this, we kindly ask you to write as an email at `fairicube@nilu.no` with `Subject: FAIRiCUBE - New user` and we will see
if we can already onboard you.

To use the FAIRiCUBE JupyterLab environment, navigate to <https://eoxhub.fairicube.eu>
with a web browser (a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari is recommended).

In FAIRiCUBE you may use a combination of Username & Password or a GitHub account to authenticate. So if you are already registered as a FAIRiCUBE user, please use your GitHub account to log in.

## Rasdaman Lab

To use the JupyterLab environment, navigate to <https://fairicube.rasdaman.com/jhub/>.
Click on the "Sign in with GitHub" button, which may forward you to GitHub where you would need to sign-in to your GitHub account.
When signing in for the first time, it is necessary to authorize the JupyterLab application to access necessary information in your GitHub account, such as the GitHub username and organization membership.

All members of the [FAIRiCUBE GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/FAIRiCUBE) have permission to sign-in.
If you get an error in the process, we kindly ask you to write an email to `fairicube@nilu.no` with `Subject: FAIRiCUBE - New rasdaman JupyterLab user`.
