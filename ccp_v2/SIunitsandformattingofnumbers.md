SI units and formatting of numbers
Apart from the validation of the Measurerer, I would like to request a consistent use of Units and meaningful formatting of numbers.
i would suggest

- MB (not GB)
- W (not kw or kW)
- g (instead of kg)

for all these we should round to max 2 decimals)

is stil stll open or are the units checked and harmonized?
I'd like to utilize standardized vocabularies for units. Within observational data, we usually utilize QUDT:

- https://qudt.org/vocab/unit/MegaBYTE
- https://qudt.org/vocab/unit/W
- https://qudt.org/vocab/unit/GM
