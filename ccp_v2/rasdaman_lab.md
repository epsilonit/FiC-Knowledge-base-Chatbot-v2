# Rasdaman Lab

## Basic usage

This section provides a brief introduction for users to the basic features of
the JupyterLab environment offered by rasdaman within FAIRiCUBE.
For more in-depth documentation on the various components, see the links in the
section [Further Information](further-information.md).


### Sign-Up / Sign-In

To use the JupyterLab environment, navigate to <https://fairicube.rasdaman.com/jhub/>.
Click on the "Sign in with GitHub" button, which may forward you to GitHub where you would need to sign-in to your GitHub account.
When signing in for the first time, it is necessary to authorize the JupyterLab application to access necessary information in your GitHub account, such as the GitHub username and organization membership.

All members of the [FAIRiCUBE GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/FAIRiCUBE) have permission to sign-in.
If you get an error in the process, we kindly ask you to write an email to `fairicube@nilu.no` with `Subject: FAIRiCUBE - New rasdaman JupyterLab user`.


### Ending a Session

The correct way to end a session is to execute the following procedure:

* Use the Menu and click: *File -> Hub control Panel*
* On the next page click the `Stop My Server` Button.
* Note: just using *File -> Log Out* will not stop your server and unnecessary costs my occur

This ensures that no unnecessary costs are incured due to a forgotten session (e.g. an open Tab in your Browser).

Once the Server has stopped you can `Log Out` as usual using the `Logout` button located in the Top-right corner.


### Logging out of Jupyter Lab

To log out, select *File -> Log out* from the menu within JupyterLab.

Note that your JupyterLab session will continue in the background even after you have logged out, but will eventually be terminated due to inactivity.
If you wish to stop your session explicitly, you can use the hub control panel as described in the [Ending a Session](#ending-a-session) section above.
