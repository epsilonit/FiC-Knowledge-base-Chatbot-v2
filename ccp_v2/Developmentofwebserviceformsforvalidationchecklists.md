Development of webservice forms for validation checklists
As for now, several validation checklists are under development or phasing out the UCs.
They are mostly meant to provide guidance and concrete validation steps to follow. Further, the guidance shall be applicable to all current and future use cases execute under FAIRiCUBE and in principle every data science framework. No use case specifics are therefore included and the checklist as the simplified and potentially main output of this deliverable will not contain results of the validation of the processing and ML applications. 

It is foreseen to make a webservice form from these checklists with an optional field for comments for each checkbox item and the guidance results with comments can be harvested and provisioned as part of the Knowledge Base services.

A first checklists is available in D3.6 
Future checklists will come under D4.6, D5.3, D6.11 ...

Actions arise from this 
- development of web-form that goes beyond MS forms functionality
- deployment under KB services
- harvest and provisioning of validation data as part of UC documentation (in KB) I like the idea.
Proposal: starting from the check-list currently in D3.6, would it make sense to add another column "How to", containing a description of the validation procedure for each item-under-test? The current column "Description" nicely describe "What" and adding "How to" could help.
Comment: your third action "harvest and provisioning of validation data ..." is not entirely clear to me, operationally thinking about how to implement it. Could further brainstorming to start formalising requirements help? 
I'm still getting my brain around the validation deliverables and the checklists, but am wondering if such a validation webservice shouldn't be described in the upcoming D1.2 we're trying to get our brains around. After all, D1.2 `is the master-task for all separate validation task in each WP and will synchronize, harmonize and collect feedback from all separate validation tasks.`
