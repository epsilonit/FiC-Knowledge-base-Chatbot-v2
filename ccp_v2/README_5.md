# Examples for Coverage Encoding

## Coverage Metadata
In the file [dominant_leaf_type.xml](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/blob/main/Example%20Files/CoverageEncoding/dominant_leaf_type.xml), you'll find an example for provision of 2 separate metadata elements within one coverage:
- First one describes the palette
- Second provides a link to STAC Metadata
