Remove old data request form from data request repo and resource metadata repo
As we're all now using the WebGUI for data requests, I believe it would be good to remove the form from the data request repo

Same applies to a/p resource metadata, don't think we need the resource-metadata request via GitHub Issues in the resource-metadata  repo

Thanks!
