harmonized documentation strategy
we need to describe how and what to document where, i.e. mostly adressing our FiC work progress apart from administrative documentation:
- UC progress
- technical progress on services & infrastructure
- specifications & requirements of future tasks, e.g. user management and access 

this shall provided in a FiC Handbook page and cover the following services
- the Teams OneNote FiC Handbook = FAIRiBOOK
- the knowledge base KB hosted by EPS
- readthedocs hosted by EOX

this issue includes a seperate sub-issue
https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/issues/37

requirement for UC documentation is markdown (MD) formatted text, to be directly inluded in the GitHub repos, can be harvested later

to be clarified : KB vs. readthedocs
suggestion : readthedocs covers all outwards looking documentation, KB can be a clever access point/interface for search.

To my memory, we'd [agreed ](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#fairicube-github-best-practices) that all such documentation is provided within the various GitHub repos utilizing markdown. This way it's very easy to shift content once we've clarified KB vs. readthedocs. 

Details in #39 
okay, even though the pick-up point for information from GitHub to RtD is not fully defined, it is not covered by the issue description and shall be subject for another ticket
