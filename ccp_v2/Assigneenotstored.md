Assignee not stored
When filling out a data request in the Web GUI, the field assignee reverts to the default setting of achtnits
The assignees list is simply the FAIRiCUBE organization members list on GitHub, sorted alphabetically. Hence the first item in this case is achnits ( it is not selected though). 
I get the alphabetic bit, also get that achtnits is just the first entry of the list. The problem is when one selects a different assignee, this doesn't get saved. When I edit again, this information is no longer visible, back to achtnits
I see, I will invistigate, in the mean time, one can assigne users directly in github
this issue should be fixed now, selecting an assignee should work now.
Thanks!
