Structure Catalog and Spec divergent
When I compare the structure of the MD catalog (currently looking at WebGUI) with the MD concepts listed in D4.2, I notice divergences on data source. In D4.2 there's a flat list of concepts, in the WebGUI these are split into 
- General
- Assets
- Organizations

Related to this is the field `Source`. Looking at the description, I'm getting the impression that this field started out as a heading as it describes multiple components:

`Origin of data (institution, etc.) including download URL / email as appropriate` 

Looking at the other fields under Data source in D4.2, I get the impression that `Source` is a duplicate of `Documentation link`

This makes it very hard to understand what fields from D4.2 correspond to which sections of the WebGUI, makes it that much harder to provide descriptive texts in the [Sheet ](https://nilu365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Horizon2021_CUBE/Shared%20Documents/WP4%20-%20share/Catalog/catalog_editor_GUI_text.xlsx?d=w303dddb27fcb4e7c82e851c3476738f7&csf=1&web=1&e=I8iDAf) created by S4E

Could D4.2 be restructured to align with what we're actually doing?
