# FAIRiCUBE Labs examples

Here we provide a series of Jupyter Notebook examples covering various aspects of EO processing utilizing the Jupyter Notebooks.<br>
These notebooks are provided by FAIRiCUBE members and by the Euro Data Cube team.

* [Getting started with the FARiCUBE Hub](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/uc1-urban-climate/blob/master/notebooks/demo/demo_processing.ipynb)
* [FARiCUBE - Sentinel Hub - data access using xcube](https://github.com/eurodatacube/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/contributions/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE_data_access_demonstration.ipynb)


* [from TIFF to COG](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/common-code/tree/main/fromTIFF_to_COG)
* [GeoTIFF generation](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/common-code/tree/main/geotiff-generation/code)
* [PyTorch Verification](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/common-code/tree/main/pytorch-verification). *Please Note:  PyTorch is currently not available in FAIRiCUBE.*
