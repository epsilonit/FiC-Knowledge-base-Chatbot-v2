Access rights policy
The project uses various datasets coming from different sources. We need to determine a policy on how all datasets get offered, internally and (when?) externally.

A first slate of questions:

- what are the (definable) user groups that require individual policy?
- what access rights should be associated with each group? In terms of data items accessible, processing allowed, quota, etc.
- who administrates users in the project (and beyond)?
- how to integrate (technically) the different tools in the Hub? See [corresponding issue](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/issues/35) for this.

being on overdrive I have created a [similar issue](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/collaboration-platform/issues/1) - please decide in which repo it is more appropriate, then I close the other. seeing no progress, although emphasized also in several webcons, is can the Technical Coordinator confirm that Fairicube will not set up a common governance policy on data access rights?
To date, focus has been on provision of correct valid datasets in order to enable further processing. 
As governance will also depend on persistence and upscaling options, this will be clarified in the 2nd half of the project. (see project Gantt)

In addition, there are very few datasets that are not openly available. As none of these are being shared by multiple UC, this issue is not highly urgent.
just to note, it is really getting "an issue", currently in dealing with issue #43.

Requesting again that we address this (standard) task asap. please review the FAIRiCUBE architecture - don't see how defining an access rights policy will provide access to missing metadata hope we can keep focus on the issue topic here, happy to discuss metadata in a dedicated issue.
