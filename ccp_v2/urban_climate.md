# Urban adaptation to climate change - UC1


This use case covers the priority “climate change” with a specific focus on the adaptation of cities to climate change. The use case would also be able to link up with other priority actions, i.e., “zero pollution” and “biodiversity”. Even the action items “deforestation” and “compliance assurance” might have a link.

Research questions:

* Do the currently available European data help cities in being appropriately informed about climate change and its impact on cities?
* Can big data (historical, real-time, and modelled forecast spatial data) and ML approaches help European cities to prepare for the impacts of climate change and take adaptive measures/make informed decisions?
* In how far can datacubes enable local, regional, national, and European decision-makers to achieve the goals of the European Green Deal?
* Does the European Green Deal data space provide the best possible means to collect, store and provide European data on climate change impacts on cities?
