How to delete entries in the catalog editor?
Some entries in the catalog editor are outdated and it would be good to be able to delete them to clean up and avoid confusion, e.g. "Global_Pesticide_Grids_PESTCHEMGRIDS,_v1.01". How can they be deleted?
Entries has to be deleted manually from github, ( closeing the PR + deleting the related branch ).
Would like me to delete https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/data-requests/pull/259  entry ?
Thanks, that works.
