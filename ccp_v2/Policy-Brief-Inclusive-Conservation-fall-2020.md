Policy Brief  
Towards an Inclusive Global 
Biodiversity Framework
Fall 2020

- 2 -
Executive Summary
In 2020, the world failed to meet a single target to stop environmental 
degradation and the destruction of wildlife. Protected areas (PAs) 
such as national parks and natural reserves are critical for conserving 
biodiversity, in particular for threatened species, habitats and 
ecosystems, from the local to the regional level, and provide multiple 
ecosystem services that enhance human wellbeing. However, 
conservation efforts in many PAs often lack effective management 
plans. A unifying challenge for PAs management is the need to extend 
and broaden the stewardship of PAs, by including the diverse visions of 
stakeholders and engaging nearby communities. 
This briefing shows how the inclusive conservation approach can 
accommodate and balance different visions for PA management, a 
crucial step towards achieving socially relevant, and environmentally 
sustainable outcomes in PAs. Inclusive approaches to conservation 
planning are also key for the implementation of the Post-2020 
Global Biodiversity Framework and other frameworks such as the 
EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. We conclude that future actions to 
improve the management of PAs - in the EU, the US and globally- would 
benefit from considering and promoting inclusive conservation as 
management approach.

Introduction 
The draft to the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework4 also known 
as zero draft recognizes that “outreach, awareness and uptake of the 
post-2020 global biodiversity framework by all stakeholders is essential 
to effective implementation”. The Framework is based on a so-called 
“theory of change”, which acknowledges for its implementation 
the need for appropriate recognition of gender equality, women’s 
empowerment, youth, gender-responsive approaches and the full and 
effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities4. 
In fact, “the participation of all relevant stakeholders, non-governmental 
organizations, youth, civil society, local and subnational authorities, 
the private sector, academia and scientific institutions through a 
whole-of-society approach and through inclusive and representative 
multi-stakeholder and multisectoral platforms 4 ‘is one of the enabling 
conditions required for the achievement of the 2030 Action Targets.4
The inclusive conservation approach enhances stakeholders’ 
engagement in PA management with the goal to enhance the acceptance 
and implementation of conservation measures. In order to ensure the 
achievement of the 2050 global goals 4, we all need to be part of the 
effort: ownership of these goals by all stakeholders is indeed crucial. 
The inclusive conservation approach can contribute to several targets of 
the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, especially to Target 2: “By 
2030, protect and conserve through well connected and effective system 
of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures 
at least 30 per cent of the planet with the focus on areas particularly 
important for biodiversity”. 4
Research within the ENVISION 
project supports the develop-
ment of an inclusive approach 
to the management of protec-
ted areas, known as inclusive 
conservation, with the aim 
of improving biodiversity and 
human well-being. Inclusive 
conservation is an approach for 
accommodating and balancing 
different stakeholder visions for 
protected area management to 
achieve socially relevant, and 
environmentally sustainable 
outcomes in protected areas. 
It has the potential to integrate 
multiple visions for growth, 
development and the conser-
vation of protected areas. A 
cornerstone of inclusive con-
servation is the application of 
multiple methods that function 
to expand the space for enga-
gement and dialogue across 
the various stakeholders of a 
protected area, such as recrea-
tional users, local residents, 
local businesses, land mana-
gers, farmers, researchers and 
local governments.1–3

By extending and br
oadening the stewardship of PAs, the inclusive 
conservation approach can be helpful in support of finding a balance 
between the conservation of biodiversity and providing the basis for 
the social and economic development of local residents. To find this 
balance is certainly the main focus of the inclusive conservation tools 
explored within the ENVISION project, but they can also contribute to 
the achievement of other 2050 biodiversity targets (as noted in the Zero 
Order Draft4), including:
• Target 12
By 2030, incr
ease by [X] benefits shared for the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity through ensuring access to and
the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from utilization of
genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. 4 
Inclusive conservation, by engaging with local communities, can
support the development of benefit-sharing models striving to achieve a
transparent and efficient governance.
• Target 15
By 2030, eliminate unsustainable consumption patterns, ensuring
people e
verywhere understand and appreciate the value of biodiversity,
and thus make responsible choices commensurate with 2050
biodiversity vision, taking into account individual and national cultural
and socioeconomic conditions. 4
The participatory planning approach that the ENVISION project
proposes creates space for dialogue and helps the local communities
to develop their advocacy capacity in decision-making processes. This
dialog can also be used to engage in local communities and promote
behaviours to eliminate unsustainable consumption patterns, as well as
create an understanding and appreciation biodiversity.
• Ta
rget 20
By 2030, ensure equitable participation in decision-making related
to biodiversity and ensure rights over relevant resources of
indigenous peoples and local communities, women and girls as well
as youth, in accordance with national circumstances. 4
This is an ob
vious target where inclusive conservation tools can
make a difference: an equitable approach is at the heart of inclusive
conservation.

Policy developments in the EU and in the 
US
On the 20th of May 2020, after several delays due to the outbreak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission finally unveiled the 
long-awaited EU Biodiversity Strategy for 20305. The strategy “aims to 
put Europe’s biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030 with benefits for 
people, the climate and the planet”. This is the chance for Europe to make 
things better in the future and to learn from past unsuccessful action. In 
the European Union, as well as globally, the 2010 biodiversity target of 
achieving a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss 
has not been reached 6; it is also now clear that the 2020 target will not be 
reached either 7. The main causes of the EU’s failure to halt biodiversity loss 
have remained the same for many years, including poor implementation of 
nature legislation, lack of resources, lack of ownership and mainstreaming 
among other sectors and policies are just the tip of the iceberg.
The new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 20305 calls for “at least 30% of 
the land and 30% of the sea to be protected in the EU” (an increase 
in protected area of 4% for land and 19% for seas areas compared to 
today). Very importantly, the Strategy commits to effectively manage all 
protected areas, defining clear conservation objectives and measures, and 
monitoring them appropriately. For the success of these commitments, 
the European Commission recognises the need to “ensure social justice, 
fairness and inclusiveness” during the implementation process at national 
level. Inclusiveness is a crucial principle when it comes to the effective 
management of protected areas. The EU’s ambitious strategy has been 
well received by the environmental community: in order to learn from and 
recover from the COVID-19 crisis, biodiversity and the European Green 
Deal must be the cornerstone of the EU’s recovery plan to ensure a healthy, 
prosperous and sustainable society 8. 
- 6 -
The new strategy aspires to help Europe to establish itself as an 
ambitious leader in the global arena during the preparations for the future 
Global Biodiversity Framework. Actually, the Strategy states that “an 
inclusive approach with the participation of all stakeholders, including 
women, youth, civil society, local authorities, the private sector, academia 
and scientific institutions”5 should be guaranteed in the upcoming Global 
Biodiversity Framework. This Framework will be approved during the 
15th Conference of the Parties to the CBD (CBD COP15), which has been 
postponed until 20219, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the United States has not ratified the CBD, there are also 
interesting developments in the country. Each of the 50 US state 
governments as well as the federal government have laws and the 
authority to protect and enhance biological diversity. Community 
conservation programs, managed at different levels of the government, 
have been developed to resolve disputes in local communities over use of 
natural resources. Inclusive conservation can help inform these programs. 
The Federal Government recently signed the Great American Outdoors 
Act. The investment under this Act, mentioned as the most significant 
conservation bill in a generation, will permanently finance the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at US $900 million per year, and providing 
$9.5 billion over five years ($1.9 billion annually), to address a maintenance 
backlog in American national parks. Lack of consistent funding for park 
infrastructure and maintenance has been a problem for decades. Similarly, 
the Act solves the long-standing problem of inconsistent funding for the 
LWCF. It will provide permanent funds for the LWCF to carry out its mission 
of providing Americans access to public lands, protecting habitat and 
strengthening communities through conservation and outdoor recreation. 
States and communities will now have more funds to use inclusive 
conservation techniques to achieve the LWCF mission.

Approach and Results
The ENVISION Project investigates to what extent balancing diverse 
stakeholder visions is possible, and how can strategies based on 
collectively defined visions be translated into sustainable protected area 
management at multiple scales. Different inclusive approaches being 
explored in ENVISION include assessing multiple visions for protected 
area management, considering their consequences collectively, defining 
new visions, and exploring power relations and different governance 
models. The overall aim of ENVISION is to inform biodiversity and 
protected area management policy, particularly with regard to inclusivity, 
participatory approaches and stakeholder engagement.
In partnership with local residents, protected area managers, local 
businesses, local governments and landowners, the ENVISION project 
explores multiple visions for protected area management in four 
protected areas on two continents: in the United States (Denali National 
Park, Alaska) and Europe (Västra Harg Nature Reserve in Östergötland, 
Sweden; Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Spain; Kromme Rijn and 
Utrechtse Heuvelrug National Park in The Netherlands).
Some first results emerging from these case studies, as well as key 
challenges and approaches to address them are presented in the 
following pages.

Framing inclusive conservation – Scientific and local 
ecological knowledge, shaping perceptions toward protected 
areas and related ecosystem services: Sierra de Guadarrama 
National Park (SGNP, Spain)
Most protected areas are managed based on objectives related to 
scientific ecological knowledge of species and ecosystems. However, a 
core principle of sustainability science is that understanding and including 
local ecological knowledge, perceptions of ecosystem service provision 
and landscape vulnerability will improve sustainability and resilience of 
social-ecological systems. The ENVISION project takes up these premises 
in the context of protected areas to provide insight on the effectiveness 
of nature protection goals, particularly in highly human-influenced 
landscapes.
A face-to-face survey was conducted with local residents in the Sierra 
de Guadarrama protected areas, Spain. Bi- and multi-variate analysis 
have been used, including path modelling and ordination to test our 
hypotheses. It was found that local and scientific knowledge, held by 
survey participants, mediated the relationship between perceptions of 
ecosystem service supply, landscape change, human-nature relationships, 
and impacts (Figure 1).
Also, local and scientific knowledge (together classified as ecological 
knowledge systems), were highly correlated and predicted resident´s 
perceptions of regulating services and biodiversity, water-related 
ecosystem services, landscape change, impacts of outdoors activities, and 
human-nature relationships. Engagement with nature, socio-demographics, 
trip characteristics, and a rural–urban gradient explained a high degree of 
variation in ecological knowledge. 
- 9 -
Figure 1: The figure represents a conceptual model showing three visions about the landscapes 
of Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain) that emerged in our findings. These visions are explained by (1) 
resident’s characteristics, (2) ecological knowledge and (3) perceptions of ecosystem services 
and impacts on the landscape. Further, (4) potential local PAs related to the resulting visions 
are shown, (5) potential challenges associated with trade-offs in perception and (6) implications 
for management are highlighted. Every vision is related to major nature conservation strategies 
identify by Mace (2014)11 (e.g. Nature for itself). These visions also link to major international 
and regional policies or strategies in environmental protection, nature conservation or rural 
development. (O) Opportunity; (C) Challenge 10
Three bundles of perceived ecosystem services and impacts, in relation 
to ecological knowledge, emerged as social representation on how 
residents relate to, understand, and perceive landscapes 10. These results 
suggest that local and scientific knowledge of protected areas and 
their management are closely associated with each other. Given these 
associations, inclusive conservation approaches need to move beyond 
distinguishing between visions based on knowledge systems. Rather, 
inclusive conservation involves managing for the couplings between 
resident’s characteristics, ecological knowledge and perceptions of 
ecosystem services and impacts on the landscape.

Unravelling responsibilities and power relations to rethink 
conservation governance: Sierra de Guadarrama National Park 
(SGNP, Spain)
In Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (SGNP , Spain), two regional state 
administrations share the legal authority in conservation decisions. The area 
is heavily used for recreation activities and encompasses a variety of local 
stakeholders engaged in extensive livestock farming and environmental 
conservation. The multiple and sometimes competing uses create tensions 
around how the national park should be governed. By unravelling the 
parks’ governance arrangements at both formal and informal levels and 
disentangling responsibilities and power relations across stakeholders, our 
study aims to improve our understanding of how stakeholders’ participation 
in decision-making is shaped and can be enhanced.  
One of the objectives of the study is to examine formal and informal 
governance arrangements in terms of stakeholders’ responsibility 
(shared vs. concentrated) and influence (equal vs. unequal) in 
conservation governance in SGNP in order to understand how 
participation is delineated by conservation authorities and illuminate 
what measures are suited for inclusive engagement. Seventy-six semi-
structured interviews and field observations were conducted with local 
stakeholders (state and non-state actors), and Park policy documents 
were reviewed and analyzed. By focusing on responsibility and 
influence, four types of arrangements have been found that characterize 
governance of SGNP—cooperative, consultative, informative, and 
prescriptive—and identified the mutually supportive role formal and 
informal mechanisms play in shaping participation (Figure 2). 
- 11 -
Figure 2: Analytical framework to classify governance arrangements in SGNP by 
typologies of governance arrangements (prescriptive, informative, consultative and 
cooperative) according to degree of stakeholder responsibility (i.e. the division of 
responsibilities between stakeholders to develop governance arrangements) and 
influence (i.e. the division of responsibilities between stakeholders to achieve a 
desired governance arrangement); (adapted from López-Rodríguez et al. 2020)12
Stakeholders’ responsibility and influence are argued to be key analytical 
axes to delineate participatory mechanisms in order to identify challenges 
and opportunities for more inclusive conservation (Figure 2). 17 In order 
to be able to enhance stakeholder participation for sustainable PA 
management outcomes, inclusive conservation approaches must be 
based on the understanding of the mechanisms through which decisions 
are actually being made in terms of shared responsibility and power-
relations among stakeholders.

Considering multiple visions for protected area management 
and assessing the consequences of each vision: THE Utrechtse 
Heuvelrug NATIONAL PARK and Kromme Rijn (THE Netherlands)
The Kromme Rijn region and Utrechtse Heuvelrug National Park, a peri-
urban landscape near Utrecht, is a multi-functional area with several 
protected areas of different sizes and designation lodged in-between 
agricultural production and residential areas. Nature conservation in such 
multi-functional landscapes needs to be balanced with other interests, and 
demands of a diverse set of stakeholders need to be taken into account, 
which represents a major challenge. Understanding values, perceptions 
and visions of various stakeholders is the first step in an inclusive 
conservation approach to inform management decision-making.
The objective of this case study is to elicit the diversity of visions 
stakeholders have for the area, as well as to visualize the spatial 
manifestations of the consequences of those visions. A series of 
interviews with stakeholders (incl. local residents) were conducted, using a 
narrative approach (called STREAMLINE) together with components from 
participatory mapping techniques. Participants were asked about which 
landscape functions they value in this landscape and to draw on a map 
which areas they believe should be multifunctional (i.e. providing several 
functions). Further, the awareness among stakeholders of competing 
interests was assessed, as well as their future visions for the landscape.
The study revealed several distinct clusters of visions such as (A) an 
inclusive cultural landscape for sustainable living, (B) a productivity-
oriented landscape, (C) a peri-urban landscape of convenience, (D) an 
environmentally-friendly landscape (see Deliverable 2.1 for more details on 
elicited visions) with different implications on which areas of the landscape 
is seen as multifunctional by the respective groups (Figure 4).
- 13 -
Figure 3: A “wordle” of pairs of conflicting interests named by participants (e.g., 
“BiodiversiyRenEnergy” – biodiversity vs renewable energy). The size of each word 
combination reflects the relative frequency with which it’s been named.
Figure 4: Proportion of respondents marking the area as multifunctional for groups 
of stakeholders representing two visions: (A) Inclusive cultural landscape for 
sustainable living, and (D) Environmentally-friendly landscape. Darker shades of pink 
indicate higher proportion of participants seeing that cell as multifunctional.
The study also uncovered that policy makers can build their strategies 
of PA management in the area on a great potential of already existing 
stakeholder awareness of a range (potential) competing interests in the 
landscape (see Figure 3).

Assessing uncertainty and building resilience: Västra Hargs 
Lövskogar nature reserve and Mjölby Municipality, Sweden 
Västra Hargs Lövskogar is a nature reserve embedded in the overall 
landscape governance of Östergötland County, Sweden. The area presents 
a mosaic of oak woodlands, mixed forests and open fields defined by more 
or less conspicuous edges and boundaries that simultaneously separate 
and connect different parts of the landscape, interests and activities.
Targeted management objectives have short and long term implications 
for alternative interests and neighboring land parcels. The collective 
capacity to assess these interdependencies and to form and revise long 
term strategies for handling emergent challenges and pressures is key to 
inclusive conservation of complex landscapes. The objective of the study 
is to explore how multiple parallel management strategies may coexist, 
complement or replace each other. Especially, at what points should 
strategies be evaluated and reconsidered? Which future uncertainties 
could give reason for such adjustments and what would it require from the 
actors involved. 
A participation based iterative research design has been used to explore a 
novel approach to building resilience, focusing on how interdependencies 
and scale effects of different existing and possible management strategies 
shape the option space available to actors engaged in landscape 
governance. Focal points are actors, actions and outcomes, embedded in 
different interests and different drivers of change.
Multiple strategies already exist, pursuing different objectives or working in 
parallel towards the same goals. They tend to be topic specific and are not 
fully aware of their interdependences. 
- 15 -
Figure 5: Landscape values in Mjölby municipality resulting from a Participatory GIS 
survey. The spatial maps depict the occurrence and density of three major value 
types in the landscape: instrumental, relating to human use; intrinsic, referring to the 
inherent value of nature and the landscape, and relational, deriving from people’s 
relationships with the landscape and each other.13
The strategies are, however, interconnected in several ways, from the actors 
who would need to be involved to the actions they imply and the direct 
and indirect implications they have for the ecological character and social 
values of the larger landscape. To ensure more resilient land sharing, policies 
have to be flexible enough to accommodate and coordinate multiple (often 
collective) strategies grounded in different objectives, rights and mandates.

Drivers and consequences of landscape change in 
a social-ecological system: Denali National Park, 
Alaska, United States
The research was conducted with six communities in the Denali region of 
Interior Alaska, which is characterized by charismatic wildlife and large tracts 
of public land within boreal forests and tundra. Local residents engage in 
(non)consumptive recreation in ecologically intact landscapes. Mass tourism 
from the cruise ship industry also plays an important role in supporting the 
local economy. Management of public lands is steeped in a contentious 
history that calls for inclusive conservation tools to support place-based 
management of Alaskan protected areas and nearby communities. 
This study advanced knowledge of how residents in communities 
surrounding Denali National Park and Preserve and Denali State Park 
characterized the region as a social-ecological system. Drawing from 
resilience theory, we identified social-ecological features of the region, 
including drivers of change, to understand and more equitably represent 
the competing interests of residents. Through participatory methods, this 
research is also identifying pathways to mitigate and adapt to multi-lateral 
policy tensions across diverse local communities at a regional scale. 
The objectives of this research were two-fold. First, residents’ perceptions 
of the Denali social-ecological system were characterized by asking 
residents to develop “fuzzy” cognitive maps. Secondly, the structural 
patterns of these maps were compared across communities within the 
Denali region to understand how residents perceived the causes and 
consequences of landscape change.
- 17 -
Fifty-one fuzzy cognitive maps were generated in 2019-2020 during focus 
groups (n = 37) and semi-structured interviews (n = 14). To answer our 
operative question, “how do local community members characterize Denali 
as a social-ecological system?” residents were engaged in a two-step 
mapping exercise whereby relevant social-ecological features of the region 
were identified and then drawn by participants in an interconnected network.
Results showed a complex representation of social-ecological features 
at a regional scale, and distinguishable patterns for each community 
were observed. The region was predominantly characterized by tourism, 
sense of community, subsistence, and wilderness. Climate change and 
large-scale development were the primary drivers of change. Additionally, 
multiple land uses in the region (e.g., natural resource extraction, land 
ownership, public land management agencies) were of concern given their 
external influence on features that were vulnerable to change, including 
rural lifestyles, recreation, and healthy ecosystems.
A deeper understanding of how residents characterize social-ecological 
systems surrounding protected areas, particularly drivers of change and 
more vulnerable features of that system, is invaluable for developing 
strategies that address stakeholder concerns. Management agencies 
can identify actions that alter system resilience according to the socio-
economic, socio-cultural, and ecological features identified in this research. 
Specifically, it should be noted that tourism is fundamentally important for 
maintaining the structure and function of this social-ecological system, as 
is the protection of Wilderness experiences, strong social cohesion, and 
subsistence use lifestyles. The two primary drivers of change identified in 
this study – climate change and large scale development – should also 
receive attention because they threaten the ability of residents to maintain 
the identity of the Denali region.
- 18 -
Figure 6: Results from 38 aggregated fuzzy cognitive maps produced by residents 
from the Denali region, AK. The mapped features spanned socio-economic, socio-
cultural, and ecological dimensions of resilience theory, as well as key drivers of 
change. The lines connecting all features show negative relationships in red and 
positive relationships in blue. The size of the nodes illustrate the relative importance 
of each feature in characterizing the region. The four most features considered 
most central to the system (i.e., tourism, wilderness, subsistence, and sense of 
community) are bolded.

Concluding remarks
The recently published Global Biodiversity Outlook 57 has served as the 
“final report” for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets established in 2010, as 
most of these targets were due by the end of this year. It concludes that 
none of the twenty targets can be considered completed and only six are 
“partially achieved” (Targets 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 and 20)7. It is thereby clear 
that the last UN decade on biodiversity has failed to reach its goals.
There are multiple reasons why the Aichi targets failed and did not 
halt biodiversity loss. One universal underlying cause was the lack of a 
strong effective implementation. In fact, implementation is the weakest 
point of the CBD. Under the Convention, countries can establish their 
own plans (the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans- 
NBSAPs) for implementation and set their own national targets. When 
evaluating the outcomes, the CBD determined 7 that the majority of the 
national targets were poorly aligned with the Aichi targets in terms of 
scope and ambition. Bases on this conclusion, the next CBD COP15 has 
to ensure that the post-2020 global biodiversity framework does not 
end up repeating the shortcomings of this past decade. The Post-2020 
Biodiversity Framework thus emphasizes the need to create enabling 
conditions for equitable participation and rights, and unleash values of 
responsibility to effect new social norms for sustainability. Undertaking 
action-oriented research to inform how protected areas governance 
can be enhanced through social engagement is crucial to address this 
policy-relevant challenge.
- 20 -
In E
urope, the final assessment of the EU Biodiversity strategy to 2020 has 
yet to be concluded. According to the midterm assessment, the targets to 
protect the environment were making some progress, but at insufficient 
rate. The results from the Fitness Check of the Nature Directives in 2016 
concluded that “the full achievement of the objectives of the Nature 
Directives will depend on substantial improvement in their implementation 
in close partnership with local authorities and different stakeholders in the 
Member States 14.
Similarly, in the US landscape, concerns have been raised about the lack 
of stakeholder representation in federal land management policies.15
Variation in governance across communities may be attributed to the 
different interactions between residents and natural resource management 
agencies over the past 50 years.16 The tensions between residents and 
agencies such as those in the Denali region could be alleviated through 
greater clarity in communication. Inclusive conservation tools can help 
resolve conflicts involving the federal Endangered Species Act, and state 
laws protecting threatened and endangered species, thus reducing the 
need for litigation and the courts to address these issues. Inclusive 
conservation approaches would also benefit state and local governments 
engaged in creating conservation corridors that permit species to migrate 
safely in naturally vegetated corridors. 
- 21 -
In this context, the inclusive conservation approach represents a helpful tool 
in the implementation of both the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework 
and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030:
• Following ENVISION’s approach of inclusive conservation, decision-
makers would have knowledge of the diversity of visions for protected 
areas and landscapes around them. When attempting to balance 
different interests, it is important to understand and recognize visions of 
different groups of stakeholders.
• Diverging attitudes and priorities towards the conservation and use of 
landscapes, including ecosystem services, can lead to tensions and 
conflicts. Understanding and accounting for the causes underpinning 
these tensions, including ecological knowledge systems and resident´s 
profiles, can improve conservation management strategies, social-
ecological resilience and landscape sustainability in protected areas.
•  Better articulation and alignment of strategies, including recognition of 
alternatives, will strengthen the collective capacity to navigate multiple 
management strategies based on principles of inclusive conservation.
•  The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework should embrace all 
voices: local communities, governments, businesses, NGOs and society 
at large should not only be invited to the debate, but their explicit 
contributions towards the global goals should be incentivized. In this 
context, inclusive conservation provides helpful tools.
•  Inclusive conservation tools can help to have better conservation 
outcomes also in Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures 
(OECMs): these are in fact complementary to protected areas, and their 
effective management will contribute to the achievement of Target 2 of 
the Post – 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.
•  Inclusive conservation can be a powerful tool to support policy makers 
in better understanding stakeholders’ participation in conservation 
governance and monitor participatory practices in order to promote 
policy changes or management interventions towards more inclusive 
conservation approaches.
- 22 -
'Inclusive conservation' helps to enhance the ownership 
of conservation goals among stakeholders, supporting 
the achievement of biodiversity targets. Future actions 
to improve the management of protected areas 
-in the EU, the US and globally- would benefit from
considering and promoting inclusive conservation for
the management of protected areas.
Future research will continue to assess the strengths and limitations 
of inclusive conservation, including possibilities for identifying and 
managing trade-offs and conflicts between different PA management 
interests. For more information about the ENVISION project with periodic
