Community Collaboration Platform vs. Knowledge Base
After some internal discussion, we've born the idea of splitting the Community Collaboration Platform vs. Knowledge Base as follows:

- Community Collaboration Platform: this is the final repo for all documentation texts. We'll probably have to iteratively refine the structure as we see what types of documents we create. Note: this does not mean that I expect EOX to organize the structure, insights for that will come from the work on the Knowledge Base
- Knowledge Base: this becomes a smart search engine for all FAIRiCUBE artifacts. One idea-in-progress is annotating the various artifacts utilizing the various STAC concepts we've collected for the description of datasets as well as a/p resource metadata for this purpose.
