# GeoDataCubes

GeoDataCubes are a powerful data structure used to organize and manage large-scale geospatial datasets, typically involving multidimensional data like satellite imagery. Unlike traditional formats, GeoDataCubes arrange data into a grid-like structure with dimensions such as time, space and spectral bands, making it easier to analyze and visualize complex datasets. 
They enable efficient querying, slicing and aggregation of data, which is essential for tasks like environmental monitoring, climate analysis and land use studies. 

GeoDataCubes are particularly useful for handling and processing vast amounts of geospatial data in a scalable and structured manner, often integrated with cloud computing platforms.
