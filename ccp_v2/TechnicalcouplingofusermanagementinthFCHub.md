Technical coupling of user management in th FC Hub
Several independent tools are integrated in the FC Hub, most prominently: EOX and rasdaman.

Q: How to establish a uniform handling of [some agreed policy] (https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/issues/34) from a user and administrator perspective? 

I imagine we need a Web page that allows an admin to manage FC users, which internally sends requests to both EOX and rasdaman? In rasdaman we have HTTP API that allow user/privilege management, it should be straightforward to use that.
Could both technical partners please provide details of user management systems available from your platforms. Then we can better identify a common way forward.
fine with us; where should we document it?

I'd have expected such info under D4.1 but it never materialized.

As user management mostly pertains to data access, how about setting up a page under data requests? 
ok, thanks for the guidance. Will start on the main page now, we can move that to a wiki page once the wiki is public again.

Have started here: https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/data-requests/blob/main/README.md#fairicube-user-management
