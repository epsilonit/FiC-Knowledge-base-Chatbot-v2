rasdaman certificate expired it seems that the certificate for https://fairicube.rasdaman.com/rasdaman/ows#/services is invalid, browser causes issues. Could you please update? any outlook on getting the FAIRiCUBE rasdaman recertified? Still get an error:
`InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_CERT_EXPIRED (0x80090328) - Das empfangene Zertifikat ist abgelaufen.`
I will fix it.

You can still open fairicube with the expired certificate, but that's a security issue. recertified, please check and then I close it.
Works! Many thanks!!!
