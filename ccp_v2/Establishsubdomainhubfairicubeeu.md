Establish subdomain hub.fairicube.eu
Can we create a subdomain hub.fairicube.eu for our FAIRiCUBE Hub interfacte and pointed to IP 159.69.180.143? 
Then CU can configure their server to properly serve the website from the repository https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/fairicube_hub

The DNS entry has been added.
The website is live now at https://hub.fairicube.eu/
