# FAIRiCUBE Query Tool

The interactive [Query Tool](https://fairicube-kb.dev.epsilon-italia.it/query-tool) allows both experts and non-experts to easily discover and analyse the FAIRiCUBE data analysis and processing resources (pipelines, pre-processing, ML models and algorithms …).
Use it to discover and analyse the processing resources of the use cases and their assets (datasets, pre-trained models, code libraries …) through the accurate descriptions contained in the related metadata.
Perform searches using keywords and pre-defined queries, or create your custom query (recommended for advanced users only).

The query tool allows two types of query: Simplified and Custom

## Consumed resources

This sub-section shows the information in terms of resources consumed by the various executions of an algorithm or pipeline. The measurements have been taken using the tool that can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/common-code/tree/main/record-computational-demands-automatically).
