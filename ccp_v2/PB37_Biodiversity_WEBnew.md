IIASA POLICY BRIEF #37
MARCH 2023
The future of 
biodiversity monitoring 
in Europe
Increasing the  
policy impact  
and effectiveness  
of biodiversity  
monitoring in  
Europe: current  
state and gaps. 
Current biodiversity monitoring in Europe is fragmented and often 
inconsistent across countries. Monitoring efforts face multiple challenges 
including insufficient technical and human capacity, limited funding,  
data unavailability, and lack of long-term policy support.
To address these challenges, the Europa Biodiversity Observation Network 
(EuropaBON) proposes five clusters of solutions to improve the collection 
and uptake of policy-relevant biodiversity data:
 J  Enhance coordination and collaboration of monitoring efforts by 
identifying priorities, using standardized protocols, and aligning 
reporting requirements with specific indicators.  
 J  Increase data standardization through the combination of Essential 
Biodiversity and Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EBVs and 
EESVs) with dedicated data sharing and exchange mechanisms that 
adhere to open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and 
reusable) principles.  
 J  Leverage modeling efforts and new technologies to integrate with 
traditional monitoring methods.  
 J  Enable additional, consistent, and long-term financial resources  
for monitoring efforts, including more and better coordination  
across countries, institutions, and sectors, along with private-  
sector investments.  
 J  Expand, adapt, and deliver capacity building, such as expert  
training, creating new exchange knowledge platforms, and 
embracing citizen science initiatives.  
We propose the creation of a European Biodiversity Monitoring 
Coordination Centre in the near future to implement lasting improvements 
in the collection, analysis, reporting, and political uptake of biodiversity 
data in all European countries.

Biodiversity data needs of users  
and policymakers 
Two main clusters of user and policy needs are of key 
importance in Europe over the next 5-10 years:
 J  Biodiversity data are needed to ensure the design 
of integrated cross-sectoral policies. They can 
provide evidence for policies on agriculture, climate 
change, infrastructure, freshwater, marine spatial 
planning, fisheries, and nature-health linkages.
 J  Biodiversity data are needed to increase policy 
impact and effectiveness to fulfill the goals 
of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Enhanced 
biodiversity monitoring can inform and 
guide policy targets on conservation, marine 
biodiversity, restoration, ecosystem services, 
tele-coupling1, and societal engagement.
Current monitoring schemes in Europe show 
biases in taxa and ecosystems 
Current monitoring schemes in Europe mainly focus on 
a subset of species and protected areas, with habitats 
and ecosystems covered to a lesser extent, and genetic 
diversity even more rarely monitored. The most 
intensively monitored taxonomic groups are birds, 
mammals, and vascular plants. However, with 
exceptions such as some bird species and some priority 
habitat types, monitoring schemes do not cover the full 
range of genetic, taxonomic, and ecosystem diversity 
within member countries. The coverage of species is 
biased, as many of the national monitoring activities 
are mainly influenced by the reporting obligations of 
the Birds and Habitats Directives (Fig. 1).  
However, the situation is more positive on the aquatic 
side, due to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), for 
which all European countries established both surveillance 
and operational monitoring programs following its 
monitoring guidance, standardized sampling, and analysis 
methods. They also intercalibrated their assessment

assessment process, which the groupings in this figure are based on. Thickness of the lines represents the number of monitoring schemes

methods, thus rendering the data more comparable 
across countries. However, the WFD’s potential to deliver 
biodiversity data could be enhanced by making the raw 
data collected widely available.
Monitoring faces many challenges 
The EuropaBON project assessed how biodiversity data 
inform and trigger policy action in Europe, as well as 
related challenges that EU countries and relevant 
agencies face. We found that most roadblocks to 
monitoring by national agencies can be attributed to a 
chronic lack of predictable, long-term funding. Other, 
partly secondary, roadblocks include a lack of support to 
establish integrated, coordinated monitoring programs 
and insufficient technical capacity. Biodiversity 
monitoring also suffers from a lack of guidance in 
identifying monitoring priorities; a lack of authoritative 
and standardized monitoring protocols; reluctance to 
adapt existing monitoring practices; the unavailability of 
data from sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and 
energy; and limited in-house knowledge and technical 
infrastructure to adequately mobilize, access, and 
analyze biodiversity data. Additionally, insufficient geo-
referenced biodiversity information is severely hindering 
the assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem trends 
over time, as well as infrastructure planning (e.g., 
detailed geo-referenced data on protected species 
potentially influences the constructions of dams or 
roads). This is partly because agencies often only have 
access to regionally aggregated assessments of species 
or ecosystems but the underlying specific (raw) data  
are not traceable or easily accessible. 
Proposed solutions to improve  
biodiversity monitoring 
The following five solutions are proposed as potential 
avenues to address the challenges (Fig. 2):
1. Improve the coordination, cooperation, 
integration, and synchronization of 
monitoring efforts. This is key to synthesizing 
Europe’s fragmented biodiversity data landscape. 
Coordinated programs need to identify monitoring 
priorities as well as standardized, efficient, and 
agreed-upon monitoring protocols. Increased 
spatial, temporal, and taxonomic homogenization of 
data collection, along with improved cross-country 
monitoring coordination and integration (ideally 
through a European coordination platform) will 
improve the effectiveness and impact of current 
monitoring efforts. Reporting obligations must 
be coordinated and provide clearly defined 
indicators for each (new) policy target, so 
that cross-country comparison is possible.
2. Enhance data gathering, standardization, 
mobilization, and sharing mechanisms. 
Strengthening the principles of open and FAIR 
data, creating public databases, and new statistical 
tools for integrating heterogeneous data, will 
make data more accessible to both researchers 
and policymakers. Essential Biodiversity Variables 
(EBVs) and Essential Ecosystem Service Variables 
(EESVs) can be used as frameworks to standardize 
and coordinate biodiversity data collection and 
monitoring. Data collected by private companies for 
environmental impact assessments could be made 
available through online open repositories, along 
with raw data collected under the Nature Directives. 
Overall, open access should acknowledge the data 
providers, and donor institutions should be evaluated 
by the impact of the monitoring they are funding.
3. Increase modeling efforts and the use of 
new technologies. Both will serve as important 
solutions to address monitoring design, methods, 
data analysis, and uptake, and have great potential 
to standardize in-situ biodiversity monitoring 
in Europe. New technologies and scientific 
advancements include artificial intelligence, 
24/7 automatic monitoring, biologgers, remote 
sensing, and Environmental DNA (eDNA) based 
on metabarcoding or shotgun sequencing. Models 
should be increasingly used to develop policy 
support tools, and the role and potential of modeling 
should be enhanced among decision-makers.
4. Ensure sufficient financial resources. 
Sufficient and predictable funding can address 
the lack of capacities in member states, foster

the integration of data and monitoring schemes, and 
maintain the long-term viability of monitoring efforts. 
Long-term, cross-country, cross-institutional, and 
cross-sectoral coordination of funding, along with 
private sector investments and adequate recognition 
of biodiversity monitoring funding needs across sectors, 
can help unlock and mobilize financial resources.
5. Build capacity to harness and develop a network 
of skills, knowledge, and people. Key solutions 
include training experts across all disciplines, working 
with existing and creating new biodiversity platforms 
in collaboration with the Knowledge Centre for 
Biodiversity, fostering extensive networks for experts 
and stakeholders to share ideas and exchange 
knowledge, and embracing citizen science as a means 
of involving volunteers in monitoring and designing an 
effective, user-driven monitoring scheme for Europe.
To achieve this vision of supporting evidence-based decision-
making through robust biodiversity monitoring data, we 
recommend the creation of a European Biodiversity 
Monitoring Coordination Center (BMCC). The BMCC can 
address the above-mentioned challenges and implement the 
proposed solutions. Such a European-wide coordination 
center is currently being co-designed by a wide range of 
stakeholders led by EuropaBON and Biodiversa+ and should 
be operational in the next two years. This center will be key 
to harnessing Europe’s rich, yet fragmented data landscape to 
answer urgent questions for policy, practice, and research.
ABOUT THE PROJECT  
EuropaBON is working with stakeholders to co-design an 
EU-wide system to monitor biodiversity and ecosystem 
services and to investigate the feasibility of setting up a 
center to coordinate monitoring activities across Europe.  
The project engages users at the local, regional, and 
European level to identify the data needs of policies and 
targets aligned with the new European Green Deal and  
the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.
The project receives funding from the European Union’s 
Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under  
grant agreement No 101003553.
The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) 
is an independent, international research institute with National 
Member Organizations in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. 
Through its research programs and initiatives, the institute 
conducts policy-oriented research into issues that are too large or 
complex to be solved by a single country or academic discipline. 
This includes pressing concerns that affects the future of all of 
humanity, such as climate change, energy security, population 
aging, and sustainable development. The results of IIASA 
research and the expertise of its researchers are made available 
to policymakers in countries around the world to help them 
produce effective, science-based policies that will enable them to 
face these challenges.
