Addition to codelist: framework. Add "no framework" and "gdal"
### Codelist name

framework

### Codelist value

no framework
gdal

### Codelist value description

no framework: analysis/processing does not rely on other package/framework
gdal: analysis/processing only employs gdal cli

### Issue faced

The current framework values are Python- and ML-centered. Pre-processing steps might involve use of other software outside Python, e.g. gdal, or also desktop software like QGIS. Here, I am not sure whether gdal can be considered a "framework", therefore I also propose to add the value "no framework" for such cases where analysis/processing does not rely on other packages (other examples: pure Python code, pure R code...).
