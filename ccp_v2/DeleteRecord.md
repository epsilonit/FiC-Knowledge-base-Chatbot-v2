Delete Record?
I've just noticed an unplanned duplicate record, we have 2 entries for ERA5_monthly_averaged_data, this is a mistake.
How can we delete a record from the WebGUI?
some user is re-adding ERA5_monthly_averaged_data instead of editing it.

Yes, that's the background of this request, accidentally created 2 duplicates. Thus the question of how to delete such inadvertent entries
I did not add a delete feature to the GUI, this has to be done manually in github for now. yes, it was me. I think I double clicked on submit while it was loading and it created a double request.  no problem, just let me know which pr needs to be removed ( link here ).
Thank you. Thank you. It's this one https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/data-requests/pull/269
closed as the entry was deleted
