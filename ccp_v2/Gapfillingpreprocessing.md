Gap filling pre processing

Regarding the field 'Algorithm' you can:

- use the [codelist change proposal template](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/resource-metadata/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=codelist_change_proposal.yml) for submit a new value for this codelist
- use the 'custom-method' value
