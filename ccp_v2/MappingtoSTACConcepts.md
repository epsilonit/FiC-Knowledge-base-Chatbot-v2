Mapping to STAC Concepts
In the previous version of D4.2 submitted early this year, the mapping to STAC concepts in the mapping table was correct, where fields where available from the STAC Spec including extensions, these were provided. Where no STAC concept was available, there was a "fic" placeholder. In addition, we had the agreement that the missing concepts would be proposed to the relevant STAC extensions.

In the latest update, not only have the "fic" placeholders been removed, other concepts that had been mapped to existing extensions are now freestyle (e.g., contact information, was mapped to the [contacts extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/contacts), now under an undefined "providers" namespace)

Please revert these back to valid STAC concepts
