Hi ,
Below are some considerations/replies to your questions:

-     Yes, "ID" value will be assigned by system (when it will be ready).
-     In "Other category" the codelist is not yet available, so we left the example values A and B. As this field is not mandatory, it can always be left empty. We could  add an indication to the field to specify that the codelist is not yet available (and remove this comment when codelist will be available).
-     The "Example" in this case could be the used Jupyter Notebook (when it will be ready to be loaded).
-     "Input data" in this case could be the OpenStreetMap link from which the data was downloaded.
-     "Characteristics of input data" in this case could be the description of OpenStreetMap data used (e.g. which layer)
-     "Output data" in this case could be the model through which you make predictions (when it will be ready to be loaded) and "Characteristics of output data" will for example provide some information on format and structure of the data expected by the model to obtain a prediction. In this regard, maybe could be good to add a comment for this field to make more explicit what we expect? : what's status on this issue? Have you made progress, or still struggling, or just forgot? ;)
