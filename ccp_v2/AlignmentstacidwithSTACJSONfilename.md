Alignment stac:id with STAC JSON filename
In order to reference the STAC metadata record in the FAIRiCUBE catalog, we'd need clarity on the naming of the individual STAC JSON files. I couldn't find the currently used filenames anywhere within the dataset metadata files, so I'd like to define that the stac:id will be reused for this purpose.

do we still need this issue in light of the new and updated data /meta data ingestion pipeline and the WebGUI? I assume that naming cavonention can still be relevant?!
I guess that's done
