# Copernicus Hub

**Copernicus-Hub** is a central component of the Copernicus program, an ambitious Earth observation initiative led by the European Union in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA). Copernicus-Hub provides comprehensive and accessible access to a wealth of Earth observation data gathered by the Sentinel satellites. The data is used across a broad spectrum of applications, from environmental monitoring and climate change assessment to disaster management and security operations.

The Copernicus program is designed to ensure the availability of free, open and high-quality environmental data to support a wide array of services that benefit public authorities, businesses, researcher, and the general public. Copernicus-Hub, as a crucial part of this ecosystem, serves as the primary access point for users to download and interact with the vast volumes of data produced by the Sentinel satellite missions.

**Copernicus-Hub** functions as the data distribution platform for the Sentinel satellites, which are the backbone of the Copernicus Earth observation program. The platform provides access to various types of data collected by different Sentinel missions, each of which is specialized in observing different aspects of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. These satellites include:

1. **Sentinel-1**: Focused on radar imaging, it provides high-resolution data regardless of weather conditions or daylight, making it essential for monitoring land and sea.
  
2. **Sentinel-2**: Equipped with a multi-spectral optical sensor, it delivers high-resolution images in visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, making it ideal for land cover classification, agricultural monitoring and disaster management.

3. **Sentinel-3**: This satellite is specialized in ocean and land monitoring, providing data on sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, ocean color.

4. **Sentinel-5P**: Dedicated to atmospheric monitoring, Sentinel-5P provides detailed data on air quality, ozone and trace gases, contributing to the understanding and monitoring of global atmospheric composition.

5. **Sentinel-6**: Focused on precise altimetry, it monitors sea-level rise and provides critical data for climate monitoring and forecasting.
