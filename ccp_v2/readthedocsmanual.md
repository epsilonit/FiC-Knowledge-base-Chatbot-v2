readthedocs manual
As the https://fairicube.readthedocs.io/ is directly accessible to all partners (via https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/collaboration-platform PullRequests (PRs)) and uses markdown language it is the right place to conclude problems&solutions from GitHub issues and/or is the platform for collecting e.g. requirements for a FAIRiCUBE user management.  What is missing :
-	General guidelines of how to use it (a session in a common topic seminar, a page in the FAIRiBOOK, page in hte readthedocs?)
-	Review existing issues and see if the https://fairicube.readthedocs.io/ has the appropriate structure
-	Communication to all project partners to explain the topology 
o	what can directly go into fairicube.readthedocs.io
o	what happens if the discussion started in a GitHub issue
o	how and what to migrate to fairicube.readthedocs.io
reinforcing this:

...I would like to tell some team member to contribute, but to this end some step-by-step explanation is needed. : Can you confirm that EOX will work on that asap? it is an essential part of our documentation strategy and as of now, it lacks some instructions how to use it! gladly assign the appropriate resource from EOX...
I confirm that I will provide a chapter "Howto contribute to ..."  during the 6th calender week (this week)
A first version of "Howto contribute to ..." has been provided: 
ReadtheDocs:  [https://fairicube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/howto_readthedocs/](https://fairicube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/howto_readthedocs/)
github:  [https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/collaboration-platform](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/collaboration-platform)

I consider this issue now complete, how to has been provided, communication to the FiC members has happened while the "Howto contribute to ..." has been provided, at least for me it's useless as I'm not working on Linux, don't have git, python etc installed. Maybe provide at least external links for us poor fools working on Windows?
Have you ever heard of Google or Bing?   ;-) 
There you get the latest links to download stuff for your OS, including instruction for the installation. 

True - no need for any documentation, we're done! ;)
to bridge the gap: I believe Christian meant that one can easily find instructions how to install the necessary tools for windows while Kathi was expressing the wish to get some instructions how to add content to the RtD on Windows? the first one does indeed not need a page in FIC RtD, wheras the latter would be useful to lower the technical bar for contribution...
The tools might be different, but in general the procedure is the same on any OS, as already described.  And to be fair both OS should be described then. 
Since I'm neither a Windows-OS nor a MacOS user I can't be of help here. I have zero knowledge about the available SW on any of those OSs. 
But since this is a RtD document, please anyone with the respective know-how, feel free to add respective information. 
I'm just miffed because I've successfully avoided this step over MANY years!!! I'll do my best to take notes when I set up here and document!
